# Voice Chat Interrupt Test

## Test Scenario
1. User A starts speaking (voice chat)
2. User B (admin) mutes User A using `/smute`, `/fullmute`, or `/voicemute`
3. User A's voice chat should be interrupted immediately on all clients

## Expected Behavior
- When a user gets muted while speaking, their voice audio should stop playing immediately
- The speaking indicator should be removed immediately
- Future voice chat from that user should be blocked until unmuted

## Implementation Details

### Server-side Changes (index.js)
1. **Enhanced mute commands**: `smute`, `fullmute`, and `voicemute` now emit a `voiceMuted` event to all clients
2. **Proper name handling**: Fixed originalName restoration when interrupting speech
3. **Room-wide notification**: All clients in the room are notified when someone gets voice muted

### Client-side Changes (frontend/script.js)
1. **New event handler**: Added `voiceMuted` event listener
2. **Audio interruption**: Immediately pauses and resets any playing audio from muted users
3. **Speaking indicator removal**: Removes "(speaking)" from the user's name immediately
4. **Muted user tracking**: Maintains a set of muted users to block future voice chat

## Testing Steps
1. Start the server
2. Join with two users in the same room
3. Have User A start voice chat
4. Have User B (with admin privileges) run `/smute [User A's GUID]`
5. Verify that User A's voice stops immediately on all clients
6. Verify that User A cannot send new voice chat while muted
7. Test unmuting and verify voice chat works again

## Code Changes Summary
- Added immediate audio interruption when users are muted
- Enhanced all mute commands to handle voice chat interruption
- Improved name restoration logic for speaking users
- Added client-side tracking of muted users
